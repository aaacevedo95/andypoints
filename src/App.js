            To be able to be oneself without filters is what I consider true
            happiness. I've said this before and I'll say it again, you are
            special. Because of that I want to make sure that you feel just as
            special as you are. If this thing we have going on goes up in
            flames, it'll be sad but know that I am so incredibly grateful I
            could at least feel this great.. and if it doesent go up in flames,
            then lets light some houses on fire together... im somewhat of a
            pyromaniac, but dont worry its a healthy amount of pyromaniac, not
            really out there "get help" level pyromaniac.

            Anyway, this is the last message, I doubt you got this far, but if
            you did let me know, or dont, there's literally no way I can know
            since these points are stored locally on your computer. And for the
            love of god, no there are no hacks or viruses here, im not as good
            as you think I am, most I can do is put a spinning poop and stupid
            messages...
